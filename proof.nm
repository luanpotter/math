# This is one of the most beautiful proofs out there, written in New Math as an example.

/begin
  /hypothesis
    /exists (a, b) @ /irrational => a^b @ /rational
  /proof
    /let[t = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)]
    t @ /real
    /if[t @ /rational]
      a = sqrt(2), b = sqrt(2) => \exists (a, b)
    /else
      t @ /irrational
      t ^ sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2 @ \rational
      a = t, b = sqrt(2) => \exists (a, b)
